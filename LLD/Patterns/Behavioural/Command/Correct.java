// Command
// Also known as Action , Transaction
// Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. (Ref: R)
// This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations (Ref: R)

// Disadvantages of this approach:
// 1. Lack of abstraction : Currently , process of turning on AC is simple it is just a single method Call . But what if in future we there are multiple methods to be called before turning on AC then client needs to be aware of all those methods
// 2. Undo / Redo functionality : We do not have undo redo functionality in this approach , and we can't expect AC to have undo redo functionality as AC in itself is a dumb object 
// 3. Difficulty in code maintainability : What if we want to support more devices such as bulb or fan , then the client will be need to be aware of how to turn on Bulb or Fan . Client gets tightly coupled with the devices

// How Command Pattern solves these problems:
// It saperates the logic of Receiver, Invoker and Command
// Receiver : The object that performs the actual action (like AirConditioner, Bulb)
// Invoker aka Sender : The object that invokes the Command . So invoker generates the command and sends it to the receiver. (Client uses invoker to generate the Command)
// Command : Logically -> It contains the code for perfoming actual action (like turning on or off) . Codewise -> It is a interface that declares a common method "execute" , Further there will be multiple concrete classes implementing that interface for each action .

// Command Interface
interface ICommand {
    void execute();
}

// Concrete Command

    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        airConditioner.turnOffAC();
    }
}

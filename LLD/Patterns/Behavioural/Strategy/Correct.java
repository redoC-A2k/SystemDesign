package LLD.Patterns.Behavioural.Strategy;

// Strategy
// Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable

// Problem (Ref S)
// Imagine you are creating a vehicle simulation game. Now vehicle can have different drive types like passenger drive , sproty drive, off road drive etc.
// See more in Wrong.java

// Solution
// We can use Strategy pattern to solve this problem. We can create a interface DriveStrategy and then create different classes implementing this interface.
// Then we can create a Vehicle class which will have a reference to DriveStrategy interface. This way we can change the drive type of vehicle at runtime.

// How to implement(Ref R)
// 1. In the context class, identify an algorithm thatâ€™s prone to frequent changes
// 2. Declare the strategy interface common to all variants of the algorithm.
// 3. One by one, extract all algorithms into their own classes. They should all implement the strategy interface.
// 4. In the context class, add a field for storing a reference to a strategy object. Provide a setter for replacing values of that field. The context should work with the strategy object only via the strategy interface
// 5. Clients of the context must associate it with a suitable strategy that matches the way they expect the context to perform its primary job

//  Suppose in future we get any new capability like Xyz drive capability then we can create a new class implementing DriveStrategy interface
